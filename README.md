My name is **Mateus** and I am a student of Information Systems at UFGD (Federal University of Grande Dourados) in Brazil. I have always been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities, which is why I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge in various areas of the field.

Besides being fluent in Portuguese, I am also proficient in English, which has allowed me to access a wider range of resources and connect with professionals from around the world.

In addition to my technical skills, I also place great value on developing my soft skills. I am a highly motivated individual who thrives in collaborative environments and enjoys taking on new challenges.
